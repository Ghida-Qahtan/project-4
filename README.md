### Description

Thanks to work done on project 3 from all of you, we now have over 31 unique published Kaggle datasets. In this project, you will have the opportunity to work on one dataset from your class's datasets, including defining a problem statement, an extensive outline of EDA up to modeling.


The goal of this project is applying one of the following :**supervised learning algorithms**, **unsupervised learning algorithms**, **Sentiment analysis** or **Time Series models** or you can build a **recommendation system**.
